# 🌟 Personal Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my **personal portfolio website** — a modern, interactive showcase built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project is not just a static portfolio — it’s an **interactive experience** featuring:
- 🧠 A custom-built **AI Assistant** to guide visitors and answer queries.
- 🔍 **Detailed project pages** for every project.
- ✨ An engaging, responsive **UI** with hover effects and animated elements.
- 🧩 **Two mini-sites**:  
  - **ML Projects:** for my Machine Learning & AI work.  
  - **Web Projects:** for my Frontend & Full Stack development work.
- 🚦 An intelligent landing page that lets visitors **choose between “ML” or “Dev”** — or **auto-loads** the correct section based on URL parameters.
