## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChiragSingh01/Diet_Planner
cd ai-diet-generator
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment & install dependencies

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Add your secrets
**Create a .env file in the project root with your API key:**
- env
- Copy
- Edit
- TOGETHER_API_KEY=YOUR_TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY

### 4️⃣ Install wkhtmltopdf
For PDF export, you’ll need wkhtmltopdf:

Download it from wkhtmltopdf.org

Install it and add its bin folder to your system PATH

Or configure it in app.py like this:
```bash
py
Copy
Edit
PDFKIT_CONFIG = pdfkit.configuration(
    wkhtmltopdf=r'C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe'
)
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Flask server
```bash
  # On your terminal:
    flask run
```

### 📄 How it Works
1. The user fills out age, gender, dietary preference, and goal.
2. Flask calls the AI model using Together AI or Hugging Face Inference API.
3. The AI generates a natural language meal plan.
4. The plan is parsed and displayed as a neat checklist.
5. Users can check items, print, export as PDF, or plan a whole week.
